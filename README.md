Add
```
<uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="X"
        android:targetSdkVersion="19" />
```
to the AndroidManifest.xml file (If doesn't already exist). Other than that, DefaultHeaderTransformer.java may give errors on line 375. If you encounter the errors change the line to 
```
.strokeWidth(strokeWidth)
```




Smooth Progress Bar
